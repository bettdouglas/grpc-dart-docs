I've been using gRPC since early 2019 & all using Dart. The only example I found which worked well was the grpc.io tutorials. Unfortunately, they're just introductory and it'd be easier to have a set of tutorials that people can modify and also showcase real world scenarios. 

Also after finding more free time, I thought why not use it to create something that the community can learn & contribute to. Also, people will be using dart more on the backend soon. Many things clicked and here we are. So please feel free to contribute your knowledge here. We learn from each other. 

Also after finding out about [https://docusaurus.io/](https://docusaurus.io/), it'd make this easier. Thank you Docusaurus.  

I hope to keep this project alive and make it a useful resource for all. 

See you in another blog post.
